@par Example Description 
 
How to enter SMPS Standby mode and wake up from this mode using the wake-up pin.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 80 MHz, an EXTI line
is connected to the user button thru PC.13 and configured to generate an 
interrupt on falling edge upon key press.

After start-up, 

1) The system automatically runs at 80 MHz without SMPS at R1.

2) After some transitions the system enters INTO RUN with 
  external SMPS R2 at 80 MHz (A).3) 
  
3) then stays 10 seconds before entering standby mode.

4) And stays in standby mode until push-button is pressed. When push-button is pressed 
   goes back to 2) and 3) 

etc.
  
@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M4 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L4R5xx devices
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-L4R5ZI-P MB1312A-01 (144 pins)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L4R5ZI-P (144 pins) set-up:
    - Use LED1 and LED2 connected respectively to PC.07 and PB.07 pins
    - User push-button connected to pin PC.13 (External line 13)
    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Disconnect toolchain 
 - Unplug the USB cable
 - Connect Amperemeter between the 2 pins of JP5 (IDD).
 - Plug the USB (starts the example)
 

Option:
 - Fast transition towards SMPS 
   in main.c uncomment the following line
   // #define NO_DELAY_TOWARDS_SMPS        1
   Comment 
   // #define NO_DELAY_TOWARDS_SMPS        1
   allows clearer step transitions.
