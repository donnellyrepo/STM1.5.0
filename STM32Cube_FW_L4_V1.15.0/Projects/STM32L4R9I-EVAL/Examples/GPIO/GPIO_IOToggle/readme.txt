@par Example Description

How to configure and use GPIOs through the HAL API. 

PB.15, PH.13, PH.14 and PH.15 IOs (configured in output pushpull mode) toggle in a forever loop.
On STM32L4R9I-EVAL board these IOs are connected to LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4.

In this example, HCLK is configured at 120 MHz.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L4R9xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L4R9I-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
