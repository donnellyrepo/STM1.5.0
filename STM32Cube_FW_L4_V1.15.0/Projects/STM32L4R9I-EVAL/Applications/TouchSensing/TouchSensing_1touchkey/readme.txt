@par Application Description

Use of the STMTouch driver with 1 touchkey sensor.
This application also uses the Environment Change System (ECS) and
Detection Time Out (DTO).

Observed behaviour:

- The LED1 is ON when the TS1 sensor is touched.
- The LED2 blinks each time the ECS process is finished.
- The LED3 blinks continuously in case of error.

- On the LCD are also displayed:
  * The ECS state (ON/OFF).
  * The TS1 touchkey sensor state (RELEASE, DETECT, ...) and the delta value.

- The ECS is ON when no touch is detected (sensor is in the RELEASE state).
  The ECS is always present but its behaviour can be modified using some parameters in
  the tsl_conf.h file.

- You can experiment the DTO by touching a sensor for few seconds. The RELEASE state
  is automatically entered and a re-calibration is performed after the timeout is reached.
  This timeout is programmable by the TSLPRM_DTO parameter in the tsl_conf.h file.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32L4R9xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L4R9I-EVAL board. It can be
    easily tailored to any other devices that embed the TSC peripheral and to
    any other development board supporting touchsensing sensor.

  - STM32L4R9I-EVAL Set-up :
    - Make sure that DSI LCD MB1314 is mounted on the board (CN16).
    
@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
