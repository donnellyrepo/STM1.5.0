@par Example Description 

Configuration of the system clock (SYSCLK) and modification of the clock settings in Run mode, using the RCC HAL API. 

In this example, after startup SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
HSE as clock source, the Wkup/Tamper push-button (connected to EXTI line 13) will be 
used to change the PLL source: 
- from HSE to HSI
- from HSI to MSI
- from HSE to HSI

Each time the Wkup/Tamper push-button is pressed; EXTI line 13 interrupt is generated and in the ISR
the PLL oscillator source is checked using __HAL_RCC_GET_PLL_OSCSOURCE() macro:

- If the HSE oscillator is selected as PLL source, the following steps will be followed to switch 
   the PLL source to HSI oscillator:
     a- Switch the system clock source to HSE to allow modification of the PLL configuration
     b- Enable HSI Oscillator, select it as PLL source and finally activate the PLL
     c- Select the PLL as system clock source and configure the HCLK, PCLK1 and PCLK2 clocks dividers
     d- Disable the HSE oscillator (optional, if the HSE is no more needed by the application)

- If the MSI oscillator is selected as PLL source, the following steps will be followed to switch 
   the PLL source to HSE oscillator:
     a- Switch the system clock source to MSI to allow modification of the PLL configuration
     b- Enable HSE Oscillator, select it as PLL source and finally activate the PLL
     c- Select the PLL as system clock source and configure the HCLK, PCLK1 and PCLK2 clocks dividers
     d- Disable the MSI oscillator (optional, if the MSI is no more needed by the application)

- If the HSI oscillator is selected as PLL source, the following steps will be followed to switch 
   the PLL source to MSI oscillator:
     a- Switch the system clock source to HSI to allow modification of the PLL configuration
     b- Enable MSI Oscillator, select it as PLL source and finally activate the PLL
     c- Select the PLL as system clock source and configure the HCLK, PCLK1 and PCLK2 clocks dividers
     d- Disable the HSI oscillator (optional, if the HSI is no more needed by the application)

In this example the SYSCLK is outputted on the MCO1 pin(PA.08).


LED1 is toggled with a timing defined by the HAL_Delay() API.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L476G-EVAL 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - Remove the LCD Glass to measure the output Frequency on PA.08.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
