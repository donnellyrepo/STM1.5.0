@par Example Description

Use of he TSC to perform continuous acquisitions of one channel in Interrupt mode.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 80 MHz.

The TSC peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_TSC_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_TSC_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed TSC resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO and NVIC). You may update this function to change TSC configuration.

The TSC acquisition is then initiated.
When the end of acquisition occurs, the acquired data are affected to the
uhTSCAcquisitionValue variable.
Depending of value of uhTSCAcquisitionValue under the max threshold values,
the corresponding LEDs are set ON.
These max threshold values can be modified in top of main.c, due to disparity link to board layout quality.

STM32L476G-EVAL's LEDs are used as follows:
  - LED1 shows the touch activity for the available channel.
  - LED4 toggles when an error occurs (TSC initialization, TSC start or assert).

@note TSCx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
file depending hardware configuration used.

@note TSCx_TS1_MAXTHRESHOLD can be modified if expected result is not satisfied.
This threshold value is linked to the board layout quality.
To calibrate these value, need to check result of uhTSCAcquisitionValue when your digits is near or touch the sensor.
The new max threshold for the channel is around 1% up to these values.

@note Timeout is set to 10 Seconds which means that if no communication occurs 
       during 10 Seconds, a Timeout Error will be generated.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L476G-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L476G-EVAL Set-up :
    - Make sure that LCD Glass is in position IO.
    - Make sure that board is configured for Touch-Sensing as 
      described in UM1855 "Evaluation board with STM32L476ZGT6 MCU" :
        - Resistors R33, R36, R38 and R39 removed
        - Solder bridges SB3, SB27 and SB30 opened (default)
        - Solder bridges SB2, SB4 and SB6 closed

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
