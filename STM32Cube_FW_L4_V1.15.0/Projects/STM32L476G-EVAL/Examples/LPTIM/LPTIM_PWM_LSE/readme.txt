@par Example Description 

How to configure and use, through the HAL LPTIM API, the LPTIM peripheral using LSE 
as counter clock, to generate a PWM signal, in a low-power mode.

In this example, the LPTIM instance used is LPTIM1 and the low power mode is Stop 2 mode.

Note that LPTIM2 can't be used in Stop 2 mode.

The counter clock is LSE (32.768 KHz), Autoreload equal to 99 so the output
frequency (FrequencyOutput) will be equal to 327.680.

  FrequencyOutput = Counter Clock Frequency / (Autoreload + 1)
                  = 32768 / 100
                  = 327.680 Hz

Pulse value equal to 49 and the duty cycle (DutyCycle) is computed as follow:

  DutyCycle = 1 - ((PulseValue + 1)/ (Autoreload + 1))
  DutyCycle = 50%

To minimize the power consumption, after starting generating the PWM signal,
the MCU enters in Stop 2 mode. Note that GPIOs are configured in Low Speed to
enhance the consumption. 

Wkup/Tamper push-button pin (PC.13)is configured as input with external interrupt (EXTI line 13),
falling edge. When Wkup/Tamper push-button is pressed, wakeup event is generated and PWM signal
generation is stopped.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L476G-EVAL
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.      

  - Connect PB.02 (pin 13 in CN7connector) to an oscilloscope to monitor the LPTIM1 output waveform.
  
  - LSE oscillator must be mounted on the board, else this example does not work.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
