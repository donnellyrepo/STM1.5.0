@par Example Description 

How to configure and use the ADC to convert an external analog input and get 
the result using a DMA transfer through the HAL API.

The ADC is configured to convert continuously ADC_CHANNEL_5, resolution is set to 12
bits right aligned, conversion is software-triggered.

DMA1_Channel1 is configured in Circular mode to transfer continuously
the content of the ADC_DR (Data Register) to aResultDMA which stores the
conversion result.

User may watch aResultDMA variable and check that its value is modified
according to the voltage applied to PA.00, directly controlled by
the Eval Board potentiometer (RV3).


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32L476G-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
