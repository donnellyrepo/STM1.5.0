@par Example Description 

How to use the different BSP drivers of the board.

Considered board is STM32L476G-EVAL board. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 80 MHz.

This example shows how to use the different functionalities of components 
available on the board by switching between all tests using key button. 

 ** Push the Wkup/Tamper push-button to start first Test.  
Blue Led (LD4) will blink between each test.Press Wkup/Tamper push-button to start another test:

 ** JOYSTICK **
Use the joystick button to move a pointer inside a rectangle 
(up/down/right/left) and change the pointer color(select).

 ** LCD **
This example shows how to use the different LCD features to display string
with different fonts, to display different shapes and to draw a bitmap.

 ** SD **
This example shows how to erase, write and read the SD card and also 
how to detect the presence of the card.

 ** EEPROM **
This example show how to read and write data in EEPROM I2C M24LR64 connected on STM32L476G-EVAL
   * The I2C RF EEPROM memory (M24LR64) is available through the connector CN3.

 ** AUDIO PLAY **
This example show how to play/pause/resume or change the volume (min 50% / max 100 %)
of an audio playback using Key or Joystick button.

      Plug a headphone to ear the sound  /!\ Take care of yours ears.
      Default volume is 60%.
      A press of JOY_SEL button will pause the audio file play (LED 1 green keep previous state
       and LED2 orange ON).
      Another press on JOY_SEL button will resumes audio file play (only LED 1 green blink at each replay)
      @Note: Copy file 'audio.bin' (available in Utilities\Media folder) directly in the flash 
      at @0x08020000 using ST-Link utility

 ** AUDIO RECORD **
@note : Make sure that JP14 and JP16 set to 3-2 position (Left side)
This example will use microphones (Mic_L and Mic_R) available on the board. Automatically, sound 
will be recorded and played on the CN20 connector at different sample rate.
Sample rate is changed at each BSP examples loop.
LED3 will be ON during record (LED1 means that playback is ongoing)

 ** NOR **
This example shows how to erase, write and read data available on the NOR flash 
available on the board.

 ** SRAM **
This example shows how to erase, write and read data available on the external 
SRAM available on the board.

  ** QSPI **
This example shows how to erase, write and read data available on the QSPI memory
available on the board.
   @note Make sure that board is configured for QuadSPI memory interface as 
         described in UM1855 "Evaluation board with STM32L476ZGT6 MCU"

 ** LCD LOG **
This example show how to use the LCD log features.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32L476xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32L476G-EVAL
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    @note Make sure that LCD Glass is in IO Position
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
