(1) User application location address is defined in the flash_if.h file as: 
#define APPLICATION_ADDRESS           ((uint32_t)0x08008000)
To modify it, change the default value to the desired one. Note that the application must be linked
relatively to the new address too.

  - STM32L476G-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the boards DB9 connector 
      and PC serial port.
    - Hold the Wkup/Tamper push-button during reset to enter the IAP.    

  - Terminal configuration: 
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 
    - Ymodem protocol is using CRC16 by default. To switch to checksum, comment #define CRC16_F
      in ymodem.c

@par How to use it? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

  1. Generate a binary image for the program provided in the 
     "IAP/IAP_Binary_Template" project directory. 
  2. Program the internal Flash with the IAP (see below) 
  3. Open HyperTerminal window using the settings already defined in section
     "Hardware and Software environment" 
  4. To run the IAP driver, keep the Wkup/Tamper push-button pressed at Reset. 
     The IAP main menu is then displayed on the HyperTerminal window.
  5. To download an application, press 1 and use the Ymodem protocol

Then
- Open your preferred toolchain
- Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
