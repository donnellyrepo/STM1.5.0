@par Application Description

How to use STM32Cube firmware with FatFs middleware component as a generic FAT
file system module. This example develops an application that exploits FatFs
features to configure a RAM disk (SRAM) drive.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock
(SYSCLK) to run at 80 MHz.

The application is based on writing and reading back a text file from a drive,
and it's performed using FatFs APIs to access the FAT volume as described
in the following steps:

 - Link the SRAM disk I/O driver;
 - Register the file system object (mount) to the FatFs module for the SRAM drive;
 - Create a FAT file system (format) on the SRAM drive;
 - Create and Open new text file object with write access;
 - Write data to the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Open text file object with read access;
 - Read back data from the text file;
 - Close the open text file;
 - Check on read data from text file;
 - Unlink the SRAM disk I/O driver.

Notice that the application manages possible errors that might occur during the
access to FAT volume, when using FatFs APIs.

It is possible to fine tune needed FatFs features by modifying defines values
in FatFs configuration file “ffconf.h” available under the project includes
directory, in a way to fit the application requirements.

STM32 board's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 is ON when the application runs successfully.
  - LED3 is ON when any error occurs.

@par Hardware and Software environment
  - This application runs on STM32L4xx devices.


  - This application has been tested with STM32L476G-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32L476G-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that LCD Glass is in position IO.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the application
