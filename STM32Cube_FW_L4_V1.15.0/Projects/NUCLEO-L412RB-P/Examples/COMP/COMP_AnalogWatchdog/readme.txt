@par Example Description 

How to use a comparator peripheral to compare a voltage level applied on
a GPIO pin to a threshold: the internal voltage reference (VREFINT), in interrupt mode.

  - The threshold is set to VREFINT (about 1.2V)
      NB: For precise values of VREFINT, please refer to datasheet.
  - The input voltage is configured to be connected to pin PB.02

LED on NUCLEO-L412RB-P Rev C can be used to monitor the voltage level compared to comparators thresholds:

- Voltage above the threshold: wake-up from low-power mode stop, LED4 blinks quickly.
- Voltage under the threshold: MCU enters low-power mode stop, LED4 is turned off

@note For debug, since this example makes the device enter in low-power stop:
      MCU must be woken-up before further download of program. Either set a voltage out of window thresholds
      or download after release of reset button.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides 
      accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. 
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the 
      peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. 
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set 
      to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L412xx devices.
  - In this example, the clock is set to 80 MHz.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L412RB-P Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L412RB-P Rev C Set-up
    - Apply an external variable voltage on PB.02 (connected on pin 18 on CN6) 
      and make it vary around average voltage 1.2V (above and below threshold) to observe LED behavior.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
