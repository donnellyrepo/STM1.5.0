@par Example Description 

How to use two ADC peripherals to perform conversions in dual interleaved mode.

ADC is operating in not continuous mode and conversions are triggered by external trigger: timer.


 - User has to connect a voltage source to the selected ADC channel input.


Note: In this example, ADC sampling rate is not set as the highest possible (ADC parameters not set for this purpose: resolution 12 bits, ... ).
      ADC sampling rate can be increased by modifying resolution and sampling time, but this will decrease the conversion accuracy.

Other peripherals related to ADC are used:
Mandatory:
 - GPIO peripheral is used in analog mode to drive signal from device pin to ADC input.
Optionally:
 - Timer peripheral is used to trigger ADC conversions.
 - DMA peripheral is used to transfer ADC converted data.
   Both ADC are using the same DMA (DMA of ADC master).

ADC conversion results:
 - ADC conversions results are transferred automatically by DMA, into variable
   array "aADCDualConvertedValues".
   ADC master and ADC slave results are concatenated in a common 32-bit data register:
   - ADC master results in the 16 LSB [15:0] (with ADC resolution 12 bits, bits effectively used are [11:0])
   - ADC slave results in the 16 MSB [31:16] (with ADC resolution 12 bits, bits effectively used are [27:16])


 - DMA is configured to operate continuously, in circular mode.
   Data is transferred by words every ADC1+ADC2 conversions.
   When DMA transfer half-buffer and complete buffer length are reached, callbacks 
   HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback() and HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback() are called.

 - In this example, dual conversion values are extracted from the common register and
   stored into 2 arrays corresponding to each ADC conversion values
   (aADCxConvertedValues, aADCyConvertedValues).


Board settings:
  ADC1 and ADC2 are configured to convert the same channel: ADC_CHANNEL_9 (Morpho connector CN6 pin 30).

NUCLEO-L412RB-P Rev C board LEDs are used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED4 is turned-on/off with respect to ADC conversion status:
    - Turned-off if ADC conversions have just filled up half of the buffer (DMA half-transfer interrupt has been triggered)
    - Turned-on if ADC conversions have filled up the complete buffer (DMA transfer complete interrupt has been triggered)
   The buffer fill up operation carries on indefinitively. 
 - Error: In case of error, LED4 is toggling at a frequency of 1Hz.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L412xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L412RB-P Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board. 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
