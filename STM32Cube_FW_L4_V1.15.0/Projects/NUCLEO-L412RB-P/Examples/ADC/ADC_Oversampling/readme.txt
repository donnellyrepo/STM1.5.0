@par Example Description

How to use an ADC peripheral in oversampling mode to increase resolution.

Description of ADC oversampling:
Multiple successive ADC conversions and average computation
are performed automatically, by ADC hardware, and therefore
off-load the CPU to do the equivalent task.
This feature can be used for the functions: averaging,
data rate reduction, SNR improvement, basic filtering.
This example uses 3 configurations of oversampling,
for comparison of final data to evaluate oversampling benefits.


Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
ADC oversampling feature is used with 3 settings:
 - ADC oversampling enabled: ratio 16, bits right shift 4.
 - ADC oversampling enabled: ratio 16, no bits right shift.
 - ADC oversampling disabled.

Connection needed:
A voltage between 0V and Vdda=3.3V can be supplied to the analog input pin PA.04 
(Morpho connector CN6 pin 30) to perform a ADC conversion at a determined voltage level.
Otherwise, this pin can be left floating (in this case ADC conversion data will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for User push-button
  1 GPIO for LED
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (Morpho connector CN6 pin 30)



For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_OVS_ratio16_shift4":   ADC group regular conversion data, oversampling ratio 16 and shift 4 (data scale: 12 bits)
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_OVS_ratio16_shift0":   ADC group regular conversion data, oversampling ratio 16 and shift 4 (data scale: 16 bits)
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_OVS_disabled":         ADC group regular conversion data, oversampling disabled (data scale corresponds to ADC resolution: 12 bits)
 - "fConvertedData_OVS_EquivalentValue12bits": Calculation of oversampling raw data (from variable "uhADCxConvertedData_OVS_ratio16_shift0") to the equivalent data on 12 bits with floating point.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L412xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L412RB-P Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
