@par Example Description 

How to use the ADC peripheral to perform conversions with an analog watchdog 
and out-of-window interrupts enabled.

One compilation switch is available to select ADC configuration continuous mode
and external trigger (located in main.h):
 - "ADC_TRIGGER_FROM_TIMER" defined: ADC is operating in single conversion mode
   and conversions are triggered by external trigger: timer.
 - "ADC_TRIGGER_FROM_TIMER" not defined: ADC is operating in continuous mode
   and first conversion is triggered by software trigger.


Other peripherals related to ADC are used:
Mandatory:
 - GPIO peripheral is used in analog mode to drive signal from device pin to
   ADC input.
Optionally:
 - Timer peripheral is used to trigger ADC conversions.
 - DMA peripheral is used to transfer ADC converted data.

ADC settings:
 - Regular group:
   Conversions are triggered by external event (timer at 1kHz).
 - Continuous mode is disabled (and sequencer disabled: only 1 channel selected) to yield only 1 conversion at each conversion trigger.
 - Analog watchdog 1 is enabled, minimum and maximum thresholds are respectively set 
   to 1/8 and 5/8 of full range scale (between about 0.41V and 2.06V with full range of 3.3V).

ADC conversion results:
 - ADC conversions results are transferred automatically by DMA, into variable
   array "aADCxConvertedData".
 - DMA and ADC are configured to operate continuously, in circular mode.
   When DMA transfer half-buffer and full buffer lengths are reached, callbacks
   HAL_ADC_ConvHalfCpltCallback() and HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback() are called.

Board settings:
 - ADC is configured to convert ADC_CHANNEL_9 (pin PA.04).
 - User has to connect a voltage source to the selected ADC channel input (Morpho connector CN6 pin 30) to run this example.
   If ADC channel is left unconnected to a voltage source (pin floating), example will run but ADC conversions values will be not valid.

To observe voltage level applied on ADC channel through GPIO, connect a voltmeter on
pin PA.04 (Morpho connector CN6 pin 30).


NUCLEO-L412RB-P Rev C board LED is used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED4 is turned-on/off in function of ADC conversion
   result.
    - Turned-off if voltage is within AWD window
    - Turned-on if voltage is out of AWD window
 - Error: In case of error, LED4 is toggling at a frequency of 1Hz.


@note In case of noise on voltage applied on ADC channel input (due to connectors and wires parasitics),
      ADC analog watchdog may trig at a voltage level with an uncertainty of tens of mV.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L412xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L412RB-P Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board. 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
