@par Application Description

Use of the USB device application based on the Human Interface (HID) with 
Battery Charger Detection (BCD).

The STM32L412xx device integrated battery charger detection circuitry supports USB-IF Battery
Charger Detection, BCD,(revision 1.2). The hpcd.Init.battery_charging_enable in the usbd_conf.c
should be set to 1 to enable the support for BCD.

This example is part of the USB Device Library package using STM32Cube firmware.

This is a typical example on how to use the STM32L412xx USB FS Device peripheral where the STM32 MCU is
enumerated as a HID device using the native PC Host HID driver to which the STM32 nucleo
board is connected,

Battery charger detection will begin automatically when VBUS is detected. The STM32L412xx includes the
capability to detect various USB battery chargers and can detect a range of USB battery chargers including a Standard Downstream
Port (SDP), a Charging Downstream Port (CDP), and a Dedicated Charging Port (DCP). For more information
on USB battery charger detection, please see the USB Battery Charging Specification, Revision 1.2 (Note 1).

If a DCP is connected (D+/D- are shorted or connected through 200 ohm resistor)
In CDP case we used a HP dock Station: charging port

@note LED 4 is ON when the BCD contact is detected (one of SDP,CDP or DCP)
      LED 4 toggles 100 times with a frequency of 10 Hz if SDP is detected.
      LED 4 toggles 100 times with a frequency of 2 Hz if CDP is detected.
      LED 4 toggles 100 times with a frequency of 1 Hz if DCP is detected.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 80 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock HSI48 USB Clock.

@note LED 4 is toggling in an infinite loop in case of system clock error.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL configuration.

@note To reduce the example footprint, the toolchain dynamic allocation is replaced by a static allocation
      by returning the address of a pre-defined static buffer with the HID class structure size.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L412xx devices.
  - This demo has been tested with NUCLEO-L412RB-P board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - Since there is no USB 2.0 Full speed connector (Type B) on the nucleo board, user has to make
    his own USB shield daughter board with the a USB connector and plug it on top of the  CN6
    connectors of the NUCLEO-L412RB-P. The USB connector has to be connected to the USB device associated GPIOs
    as follows:
    - DP (D+ of the USB connector) <======> PA12 (Nucleo board)
    - DM (D- of the USB connector) <======> PA11 (Nucleo board)
    - VBUS oof the USB connector <======> PA9 ( Nucleo board)
    - GND of the USB connector <======> GND ( Nucelo board)
    To improve EMC performance (noise immunity and signal integrity), it is recommended to connect a 100nF
	ceramic capacitor to the USB VDD pin.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
