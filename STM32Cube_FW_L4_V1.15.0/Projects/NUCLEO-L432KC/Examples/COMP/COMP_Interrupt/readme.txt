@par Example Description 

How to use a comparator peripheral to compare a voltage level applied on a GPIO
pin to the the internal voltage reference (VREFINT), in interrupt mode. 
When the comparator input crosses (either rising or falling edges) the internal 
reference voltage VREFINT (1.22V), the comparator generates an interrupt
and exit from Stop 2 mode.

The System enters Stop 2 mode 5 seconds after the comparator is started and 
after any system wake-up triggered by the comparator interrupt.

In this example, the comparator input is connected on the pin PA.01 the user 
shall apply a voltage on and each time the comparator input crosses VREFINT, LED3 toggles.
If LED3 is toggling continuously without any voltage update, it indicates that the system 
generated an error.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides 
      accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. 
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the 
      peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. 
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set 
      to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L432xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L432KC RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L432KC RevC Set-up

    - Use LED3 connected to PB.03 pin
    - Apply an external variable voltage on PA.01 (connected on pin 11 on CN4 (A1)) with average voltage 1.22V.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
