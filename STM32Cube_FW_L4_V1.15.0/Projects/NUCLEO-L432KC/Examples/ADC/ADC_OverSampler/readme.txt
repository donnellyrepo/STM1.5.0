@par Example Description 

How to use an ADC peripheral in oversampling mode to increase resolution.

The ADC is configured to convert continuously ADC_CHANNEL_9 connected to GPIO_PIN_4 of GPIOA
while the oversampler is enabled. 
Oversampling ratio is set to ADC_OVERSAMPLING_RATIO_128 so the maximum output result 
is 0xFFF * 128 = 0x7FF80 (19 bits).
Since the ADC_DR is a 16-bit long register, a 3-bit right shift is performed to 
keep only the 16 most significant bits.

uwConvertedValue variable contains the 16-bit conversion result and 
uwInputVoltage yields the input voltage in mV. 

Use an external power supply, adjust supply voltage and connect it to pin GPIO_PIN_4 of GPIOA (Arduino pin A3).
This allows to modify ADC_CHANNEL_9 voltage.
The converted value is monitored through debugger: uwConvertedValue and uwInputVoltage variables.

STM32 board LED can be used to monitor the conversion:
  - LED3 is ON when there is an error occurs.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
