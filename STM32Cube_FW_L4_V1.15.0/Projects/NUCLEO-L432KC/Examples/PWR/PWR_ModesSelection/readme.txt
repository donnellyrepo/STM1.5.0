@par Example Description 
 
How to configure the system to measure the current consumption in different 
low-power modes.
The objective is to provide a mean to 
measure the power consumption using an amperemeter on IDD connector. 

The SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms and in the SysTick 
interrupt handler.

@note To measure the current consumption remove JP1 jumper 
      and connect an amperemeter to JP1 to measure IDD current.     

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M4 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L432xx devices

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-L432KC RevC
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L432KC RevC Set-up
    - LED3 connected to PB.03 pin.
	- USART2 interface connected to ST-LINK

  - HyperTerminal setup of COM port associated to STLink Virtual COM Port:
    - Baud rate = 9600 
    - Data = 8 bit
	- Parity = none
    - Stop = 1 bit
    - No hardware flow control

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
