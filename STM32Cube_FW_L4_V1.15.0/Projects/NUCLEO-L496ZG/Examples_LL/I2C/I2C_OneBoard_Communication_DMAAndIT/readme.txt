@par Example Description

How to transmit data bytes from an I2C master device using DMA mode 
to an I2C slave device using interrupt mode. The peripheral is initialized with 
LL unitary service functions to optimize for performance and size.

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of LL API
to configure GPIO, DMA and I2C peripherals using only one NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins).

I2C1 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode with EXTI (Clock 400Khz, Own address 7-bit enabled).
I2C3 Peripheral is configured in Master mode with DMA (Clock 400Khz).
GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 

LED1 blinks quickly to wait for user-button press. 

Example execution:
Press the User push-button to initiate a write request by Master through Handle_I2C_Master() routine.
This action will generate an I2C start condition with the Slave address and a write bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C1, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C1 IRQ Handler routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction Write.
This will allow Slave to enter in receiver mode and then acknowledge Master to send the bytes through DMA.
When acknowledge is received on I2C3, DMA transfer the data from flash memory buffer to I2C3 TXDR register.
This will allow Master to transmit a byte to the Slave.
Each time a byte is received on I2C1 (Slave), an RXNE interrupt occurs until a STOP condition.
And so each time the Slave acknowledge the byte received,
DMA transfer the next data from flash memory buffer to I2C3 TXDR register until Transfer completed.
Master auto-generate a Stop condition when DMA transfer is achieved.

The STOP condition generate a STOP interrupt and initiate the end of reception on Slave side.
I2C1 IRQ handler and Handle_I2C_Master() routine are then clearing the STOP flag in both side.

LED1 is On if data are well received.

In case of errors, LED1 is blinking.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L496ZG devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) Set-up
    - Connect GPIOs connected to I2C1 SCL/SDA (PB.8 and PB.9)
    to respectively SCL and SDA pins of I2C3 (PC.0 and PC.1).
      - I2C1_SCL  PB.8 (CN12, pin 3) : connected to I2C3_SCL PC.0 (CN11, pin 38) 
      - I2C1_SDA  PB.9 (CN12, pin 5) : connected to I2C3_SDA PC.1 (CN11, pin 36)

  - Launch the program. Press User push-button to initiate a write request by Master 
      then Slave receive bytes.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
