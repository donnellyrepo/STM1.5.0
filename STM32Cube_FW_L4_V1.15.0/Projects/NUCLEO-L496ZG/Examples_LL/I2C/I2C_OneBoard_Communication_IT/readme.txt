@par Example Description

How to handle the reception of one data byte from an I2C slave device 
by an I2C master device. Both devices operate in interrupt mode. The peripheral is initialized 
with LL unitary service functions to  optimize for performance and size.

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of LL API
to configure GPIO and I2C peripherals using only one NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins).

I2C1 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode with EXTI (Clock 400Khz, Own address 7-bit enabled).
I2C3 Peripheral is configured in Master mode with EXTI (Clock 400Khz).
GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 

LED1 blinks quickly to wait for user-button press. 

Example execution:
Press the User push-button to initiate a read request by Master.
This action will generate an I2C start condition with the Slave address and a read bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C1, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C1 IRQ Handler routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction Read.
This will allow Slave to enter in transmitter mode and then send a byte when TXIS interrupt occurs.
When byte is received on I2C3, an RXNE interrupt occurs.
When RXDR register is read, Master auto-generate a NACK and STOP condition
to inform the Slave that the transfer is finished.
The NACK condition generate a NACK interrupt in Slave side treated in the I2C1 IRQ handler routine by a clear of NACK flag.
The STOP condition generate a STOP interrupt in both side (Slave and Master). I2C1 and I2C3 IRQ handler routine are then
clearing the STOP flag in both side.

LED1 is On if data is well received.

In case of errors, LED1 is blinking.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L496ZG devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) Set-up
    - Connect GPIOs connected to I2C1 SCL/SDA (PB.8 and PB.9)
    to respectively SCL and SDA pins of I2C3 (PC.0 and PC.1).
      - I2C1_SCL  PB.8 (CN12, pin 3) : connected to I2C3_SCL PC.0 (CN11, pin 38) 
      - I2C1_SDA  PB.9 (CN12, pin 5) : connected to I2C3_SDA PC.1 (CN11, pin 36)

  - Launch the program. Press User push-button to initiate a read request by Master 
      then Slave send a byte.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
