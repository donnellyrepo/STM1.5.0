@par Example Description

How to enter Stop 2 mode.

After start-up LED1 is toggling during 5 seconds, then the system automatically 
enter in STOP2 mode (Final state).

LED1 is used to monitor the system state as follows:
 - LED1 toggling : system in RUN mode
 - LED1 off : system in STOP2 mode

@note To measure the current consumption in STOP2 mode, remove JP5 jumper 
      and connect an ampere meter to JP5 to measure IDD current.     

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M4 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L496xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) Set-up
    - LED1 connected to PC.07 pin

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
