@par Example Description

Configuration of the SWPMI peripheral to start a communication 
using No software buffer mode in Loopback mode. The peripheral initialization uses 
LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
MSI as clock source.

The SWP frame transmission handling is done by polling status flags inside SWPMI interrupt 
routines.
SWPMI is set in loopback mode with max bitrate of 2Mbit/s. 
Connection needed: 
 - None, because SWPMI is in loopback mode (mode for test purpose, connection is done internally).

LED1 blinks quickly to wait for user-button press. 
As soon as, user-button is pressed, SWPMI communication starts in IT mode:

Transmission:
- In SWPMI transmit buffer empty interrupt routine, frame transmission is started 
  by the first write to the SWPMI_TDR register (the low significant byte of the first 32-bit 
  word indicates the number of data bytes in the payload)
- All the remaining payload data are sent through the Transmit interrupt routine
- Transmission is stopped when the complete frame is sent (detected again through transmit 
  buffer empty interrupt routine)
  
Reception:
- All the data are received through RXNE interrupt routine.
- Once the complete frame has been received, including the CRC and the End of frame 
 (EOF), both RXNE and RXBFF flags are set and reception process is stopped
 
End of transfer:
- It detects when transfer complete flag is detected. 
- Then, a check is done between the reception buffer and the expected reception
buffer:
   - LED1 ON: successful transmission
   - LED1 blinks with 1 sec period: an error occurred during transmission.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L496ZG devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
