@par Example Description

Configuration of the SWPMI peripheral to start a communication 
using DMA multibuffers in Loopback mode. The peripheral initialization uses 
LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
MSI as clock source.

Then, DMA configuration is done to enable TX/RX channels for SWPMI links and set the different buffers 
which will be used for the transfer. 
SWPMI is set in loopback mode with max bitrate of 2Mbit/s. 
Connection needed: 
 - None, because SWPMI is in loopback mode (mode for test purpose, connection is done internally).

LED1 blinks quickly to wait for user-button press. 
As soon as, user-button is pressed, SWPMI communication starts in DMA mode:
- DMA Circular mode enabled
- In SWPMI transfer buffer empty interrupt routine, when 3 1st frames have
  been transmitted, an update of the Multi buffer is done with 3 new frames
- In the same routine, when last frame has been sent, a frame payload size erase is done 
  to stop automatically SWPMI TX DMA.
- A the end of the transfer, a check is done between the reception buffer and the expected reception 
buffer:
   - LED1 ON: successful transmission
   - LED1 blinks with 1 sec period: an error occurred during transmission.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L496ZG devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ?
