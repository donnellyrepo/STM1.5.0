@par Example Description

Configuration of the TIM peripheral to generate a timebase. This 
example is based on the STM32L4xx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization 
uses LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size). 

   In this example TIM1 input clock TIM1CLK is set to APB2 clock (PCLK2),   
   since APB2 pre-scaler is equal to 1.                                     
      TIM1CLK = PCLK2                                                       
      PCLK2 = HCLK                                                          
      => TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock (80 MHz)                                 

To set the TIM1 counter clock frequency to 10 KHz, the pre-scaler (PSC) is calculated as follows:
PSC = (TIM1CLK / TIM1 counter clock) - 1
PSC = (SystemCoreClock /10 KHz) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 80 MHz for STM32L4xx Devices.

The auto-reload (ARR) is calculated to get a time base period of 100ms,
meaning that initial time base frequency is 10 Hz.
ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / time base frequency) - 1
ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / 10) - 1

Update interrupts are enabled. Within the update interrupt service routine pin PC.07
(connected to LED1 on board NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins)) is toggled.

User push-button can be used to modify the time base period from 100 ms
to 1 s in 100 ms steps. To do so, every time User push-button is pressed, the
autoreload register (ARR) is updated. In up-counting update event is generated 
at each counter overflow (when the counter reaches the auto-reload value). 

Finally the time base frequency is calculated as follows:
time base frequency = TIM1 counter clock /((PSC + 1)*(ARR + 1)*(RCR + 1))
