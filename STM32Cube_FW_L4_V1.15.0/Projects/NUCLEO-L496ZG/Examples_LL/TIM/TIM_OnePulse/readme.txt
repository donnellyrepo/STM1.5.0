@par Example Description

Configuration of a timer to generate a positive pulse in 
Output Compare mode with a length of tPULSE and after a delay of tDELAY. This example 
is based on the STM32L4xx TIM LL API. The peripheral initialization uses 
LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

The pulse is generated on OC2.

This example uses 2 timer instances:

  - TIM1 generates a positive pulse of 50 us after a delay of 50 us. User push-button
    is used to start TIM1 counter. 
    
                                              ___
                                             |   |
    User push-button ________________________|   |________________________________        
                                                            ___________
                                                           |           |
    OC1              ______________________________________|           |________
    (TIM1_CH1)                                <---50 us---><---50 us--->
                                                |            |_ uwMeasuredPulseLength
                                                |_ uwMeasuredDelay

  TIM1_CH1 delay and pulse length are measured every time a pulse is generated. 
  Both can be observed through the debugger by monitoring the variables uwMeasuredDelay and
  uwMeasuredPulseLength respectively.

  - TIM3 generates a positive pulse of 3 s after a delay of 2 s. TIM3 counter start
    is controlled through the slave mode controller. TI1FP1 signals is selected as
    trigger input meaning that TIM3 counter starts when a rising edge is detected on
    TI1FP1. The TIM3 output channel is mapped on the pin PC.07 (connected to LED1 on board
    NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins)). Thus LED1 status (on/off) mirrors the timer output level (active v.s. inactive).

    TI1                          |___|
    (TIM3_CH1)
        ______________________________________                             ____
                                              |                           |
    OC2                                       |___________________________|
    (TIM3_CH2)                   <-----2s-----><----------3 s------------->
   

Both TIM1 and TIM3 are configured to generate a single pulse (timer counter 
stops automatically at the next update event (UEV).

Connecting TIM1 OC1 to TIM3 TI1 allows to trigger TIM3 counter by pressing
the User push-button.
