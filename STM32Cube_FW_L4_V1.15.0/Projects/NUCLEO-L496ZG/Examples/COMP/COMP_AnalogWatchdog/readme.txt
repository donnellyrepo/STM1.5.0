@par Example Description 

How to use a comparator peripheral to compare a voltage level to a threshold: 
the internal voltage reference (VREFINT), in interrupt mode.

  - The upper threshold is set to VREFINT (about 1.2V)
  - The lower threshold is set to VREFINT / 4 (about 0.3V)
      NB: For precise values of VREFINT & VREFINT/4, please refer to datasheet.
  - The input voltage is configured to be connected to pin PC.05
The MCU wakes up from Stop mode when the input voltage is above the higher threshold.

LED on NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) can be used to monitor the voltage level compared to comparators thresholds:

- LED1 blinks quickly when input voltage is above the higher threshold.
- LED1 blinks slowly (once every 1 s) if the input voltage is under the lower threshold.
- If the input voltage is within the thresholds, the MCU is set in STOP1 mode. LED1 does not blink.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides 
      accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. 
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the 
      peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. 
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set 
      to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32L496ZG devices.
  - In this example, the clock is set to 80 MHz.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) Set-up
    - Apply an external variable voltage on PC.05 (connected on pin 6 on CN12) with average voltage 1.22V.
    NB: With SB181 "ON", the applied voltage will be limited to about 1.6V

    Use an external power supply and adjust supply voltage (above, within and below thresholds),
    and connect it on PC.05
        
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
