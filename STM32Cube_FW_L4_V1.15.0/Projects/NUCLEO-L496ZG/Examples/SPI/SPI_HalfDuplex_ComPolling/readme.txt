  |_STM32   Master _________|                      |_STM32   Slave __________|

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 80 MHz.

The SPI peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_SPI_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_SPI_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed SPI resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK & 
GPIO). You may update this function to change SPI configuration.

The communication is handled with direct register access. 
On slave side, a state machine manage the differents communication step, to handle
two kinds of communication:
 - register read : master use this operation to get a value from the slave.
 - register write: master use this operation to update a value on slave side.
On master side basic operations are done by calling the functions : Command_write 
and Command_read

The user can choose between Master and Slave through "#define MASTER_BOARD"
in the "main.h" file.
If the Master board is used, the "#define MASTER_BOARD" must be uncommented.
If the Slave board is used the "#define MASTER_BOARD" must be commented.

This example desmonstrate how to implement a basic protocol between master and slave. 
The master is writting and reading a register and check that write and read value are 
identical. The slave sw is an infinite loop which execute the operation requested by the master.

In a first step after the user press the User push-button, SPI Master starts slave communication 
, a loop to request READ_COUNTER_COMMAND and WRITE_COUNTER_COMMAND. The master control the 
communcation by a comparaison between the read and write value. 

STM32 board's LEDs can be used to monitor the master transfer status:
 - LED1 toggles slowly on master board waiting User push-button to be pressed.
 - LED2 toggles quickly on master when the test is running.
 - LED3 turns ON on master when register comparison failed.   

@note SPIx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
      file depending hardware configuration used.

@note You need to perform a reset on Slave board, then perform it on Master board
      to have the correct behaviour of this example.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L496ZG devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  -NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) Set-up
    - Connect Master board CLK to Slave Board CLK (pin 15 on CN7 connector)
    - Connect Master board MOSI (pin 13 on CN7 connector) to Slave Board MISO (pin 19 on CN7 connector)
    - Connect Master board GND to Slave Board GND
    - Slave board powered by master board
          - JP3 fitted on E5V on Slave board
          - Connect Master board +5V (pin 9 on CN8 connector) to Slave board E5V (pin 6 on CN11 connector)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
    o Uncomment "#define MASTER_BOARD" and load the project in Master Board
    o Comment "#define MASTER_BOARD" and load the project in Slave Board
 - Run the example
