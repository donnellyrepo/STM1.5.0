@par Example Description 

How to use the CRYP AES peripheral to suspend then resume the AES ECB, CBC and
CTR processing of a message in order to carry out the encryption or decryption
of a higher-priority message. 


For ECB algorithm,
  AES 128 ECB encryption of a low priority message (8-bit data type) is interrupted by the
  AES 256 ECB encryption of a high priority message (32-bit data type).
For CBC algorithm, 
  AES 256 CBC encryption of a low priority message (32-bit data type) is interrupted by the
  AES 128 CBC encryption of a high priority message (8-bit data type).
For CTR algorithm,  
  AES 128 CTR encryption of a low priority message (8-bit data type) is interrupted by the
  AES 256 CTR decryption of a high priority message (32-bit data type).
  
Once the high priority message processing is over, the low priority message
encryption is resumed.  
 
Note that the AES HW IP allows to suspend a specific chaining algorithm to
carry out another chaining algorithm processing (e.g. a CTR processing can
interrupt a CBC processing, which can be resumed once the CTR encryption or
decryption is over).




The example unrolls as follows: 
- AES ECB low-priority message encryption started, suspended by high priority message ECB encryption
  then resumed to end the low priority message processing
- AES CBC low-priority message encryption started, suspended by high priority message CBC encryption
  then resumed to end the low priority message processing
- AES CTR low-priority message encryption started, suspended by high priority message CTR decryption
  then resumed to end the low priority message processing  



Low and high-priority blocks AES outputs are compared with expected outputs.
When resorting to IAR Embedded Workbench IDE, AES algorithms processing status
are displayed on debugger Terminal I/O as follows: View --> Terminal I/O.
When resorting to MDK-ARM KEIL IDE, AES algorithms processing status 
are displayed on debugger as follows:  View --> Serial Viewer --> Debug (printf) Viewer.
When resorting to AC6 SW4STM32 IDE:
 In Debug configuration window\ Startup, in addition to "monitor reset halt" add the command "monitor arm semihosting enable"
 Command Code is displayed on debugger as follows: Window--> Show View--> Console.

When all ciphering and deciphering operations are successful, LED1 is turned on.
In case of ciphering or deciphering issue, LED3 is turned on.

@par Hardware and Software environment

   - This example runs on STM32L4A6ZG devices.
  
    - This example has been tested with a STM32L4A6ZG mounted on a 
    Nucleo (144 pins) board and can be easily tailored to any other supported 
    device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
