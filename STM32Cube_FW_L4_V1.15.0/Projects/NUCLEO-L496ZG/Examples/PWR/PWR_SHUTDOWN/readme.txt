@par Example Description 
 
How to enter the Shutdown mode and wake up from this mode by using an external 
reset or the WKUP pin.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 80 MHz.
The SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms and in the SysTick 
interrupt handler, LED1 is turned on / toggled in order to indicate whether the 
MCU is in SHUTDOWN or RUN mode.

Five seconds after power up, the MCU automatically enters SUTDOWN.
LED1 is toggling during these five seconds.

The user can wake-up the system in pressing the User push-button which is connected
to the wake-up pin PWR_WAKEUP_PIN2.
A falling edge on the wake-up pin wakes-up the system from SHUTDOWN.
Alternatively, an external RESET of the board leads to a system wake-up as well.

After wake-up from SHUTDOWN mode, program execution restarts from the beginning.
Exit from SHUTDOWN is detected thru a flag set in an RTC back-up register; in
such a case, LED1 is kept on for about 2 sec. before toggling again.

Five seconds after wake-up, the MCU automatically enters SHUTDOWN again.

LED1 is used to monitor the system state as follows:
 - LED1 toggling : system in RUN mode
 - LED1 is on for about 2 sec. : system is restarting and out-of-shutdown has been detected
 - LED1 off : system in SHUTDOWN mode
 - LED3 is on : system in ERROR mode

These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.

@note To measure the current consumption in SHUTDOWN mode, remove IDD_JP jumper 
      and connect an amperemeter to IDD_JP to measure IDD current.     

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode, this is due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M4 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) Set-up
    - LED1 connected to PC.07 pin
    - LED3 connected to PB.14 pin    
    - WakeUp Pin PWR_WAKEUP_PIN2 connected to PC.13

  - This example runs on STM32L4xx devices
      
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
