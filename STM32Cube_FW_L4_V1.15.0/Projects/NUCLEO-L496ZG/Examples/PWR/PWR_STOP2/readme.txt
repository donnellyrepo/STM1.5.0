@par Example Description 
 
How to enter the Stop 2 mode and wake up from this mode by using external reset 
or wakeup interrupt.

In the associated software, the system clock is set to 80 MHz, an EXTI line
is connected to the user button thru PC.13 and configured to generate an 
interrupt on falling edge upon key press.
The SysTick is programmed to generate an interrupt each 1 ms and in the SysTick 
interrupt handler, LED1 is toggled in order to indicate whether the MCU is in Stop 2 mode 
or RUN mode.

5 seconds after start-up, the system automatically enters Stop 2 mode and 
LED1 stops toggling.

The User push-button can be pressed at any time to wake-up the system. 
The software then comes back in RUN mode for 5 sec. before automatically entering Stop 2 mode again. 

Two leds LED1 and LED2 are used to monitor the system state as following:
 - LED2 ON: configuration failed (system will go to an infinite loop)
 - LED1 toggling: system in RUN mode
 - LED1 off : system in Stop 2 mode

These steps are repeated in an infinite loop.

@note To measure the current consumption in Stop 2 mode, please refer to 
      @subpage PWR_CurrentConsumption example.

@note This example can not be used in DEBUG mode due to the fact 
      that the Cortex-M4 core is no longer clocked during low power mode 
      so debugging features are disabled.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L4xx devices

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - NUCLEO-L496ZG (144 pins) set-up:
    - Use LED1 and LED2 connected respectively to PC.07 and PB.07 pins
    - User push-button connected to pin PC.13 (External line 13)

        
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
