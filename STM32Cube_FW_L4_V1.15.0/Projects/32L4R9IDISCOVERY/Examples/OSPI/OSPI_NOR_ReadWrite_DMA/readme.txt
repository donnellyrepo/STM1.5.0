@par Example Description

How to use a OSPI NOR memory in DMA mode.

This example describes how to erase part of a OSPI NOR memory, write data in DMA mode, read data in DMA mode 
and compare the result in an infinite loop.

LED_GREEN toggles each time a new comparison is good
LED_ORANGE is on as soon as a comparison error occurs
LED_ORANGE toggles as soon as an error is returned by HAL API

In this example, HCLK is configured at 120 MHz.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32L4R9xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with 32L4R9IDISCOVERY board and can be 
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
