@par Example Description

  How to configure the DMA2D peripheral in Memory-to-memory transfer mode with
  pixel format conversion (PFC) mode.

  At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
  all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
  Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
  clock (SYSCLK) to run at 80 MHz.
 
  In this basic example the goal is to explain the different fields of the DMA2D 
  structure in the case of Memory_to_Memory with pixel format conversion (PFC) transfer mode
  and the difference between pixel coded on 32bits (ARGB8888 format) and coded on 16bits (RGB565 format).
  
  An image is transferred with DMA2D from the Flash memory to the LCD and during the transfer,
  a pixel format conversion is applied from ARGB8888 (32 bpp) to RGB565 (16 bpp).   
  
 How to convert pixel format from ARGB8888 to RGB565 ?
 => transparency information is discarded 
 => only the five MSBs (for R and B) and six MSBs (for G) are taken into account 
 eg : 0x A7..A0  B7..B0 C7..C0 D7..D0 -->  B7..B3 C7..C2 D7..D3    
          |_|     |_|    |_|    |_|         |_|    |_|    |_|
           A       R      G      B           R      G      B  
         
Generally speaking, 
 => if the number of bits per pixel in source data is more then the number of 
    bits per pixel in destination data, only the MSB are taken into account
    
 => else, if the number of bits per pixel in source data is less then the number 
    of bits per pixel in destination data, a bit replication of MSB in LSB is applied
    
    eg : from ARGB1555 to ARGB8888       PFC
    0xAB35 --> 0b1 01010 11001 10101   -------> 0b11111111 01010010 11001110 10101101     
                 A   R     G     B          --> 0xFF       52       CE       AD

STM32L496G-Discovery board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when there is an initialization or a DMA2D transfer error.
 - LED2 is ON when the DMA2D transfer is complete.
         
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32L496xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32L496G-Discovery boards and can be easily 
    tailored to any other supported device and development board. 


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
