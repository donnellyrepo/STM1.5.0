@par Example Description 

How to configure the DMA2D peripheral in Memory-to-memory transfer mode.
The example transfers with DMA2D an internal SRAM static texture array aBufferInput[] of size 16x32 
and format ARGB4444 (16 bpp) to destination buffer in internal SRAM in array aBufferResult[].
The number of bytes transferred is then 16x32x2=1024 bytes.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the SYSTICK.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 80 MHz.

In this basic example the goal is to explain the different fields of the DMA2D 
structure in the case of Memory_to_Memory transfer mode.

After DMA2D configuration, the data transfer is performed and then the transferred 
data are checked byte per byte in comparing the source and destination buffers aBufferInput[] and aBufferResult[].   

STM32L496G-Discovery board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED2 is ON when the DMA2D transfer is complete and when the data are correctly transferred.
 - LED1 is ON when there is a DMA2D transfer error or when data are not correctly transferred
          or when there is an error in DMA2D transfer/Init process.
If everything is all right, at the end of the test, LED2  must be ON, LED1 must be OFF.
 
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L496xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L496G-Discovery board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.      

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
