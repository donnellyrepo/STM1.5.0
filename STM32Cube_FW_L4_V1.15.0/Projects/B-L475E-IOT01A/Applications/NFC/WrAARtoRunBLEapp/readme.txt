@par Application Description

This application aims at showing how to write an AAR NDEF message to an M24SR type 4 NFC tag 
so that the BLE STM32 Profiles application is launched on the smartphone when it comes near the 
NFC antenna .

First the NFC component is initialised, the LED2 goes ON to indicate Initialization is terminated.
Then an AAR NDEF message is written such that when the smartphone approches the NFC antenna 
the BLE STM32 Profiles application is launched on the smartphone.
If the application is not already installed, the smartphone will automatically search it and download it 
from the Google Play store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stm.bluetoothlevalidation)

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This application runs on STM32L475XX devices, B-L475E-IOT01A board (MB1297) 
    
  - This application has been tested with the following environment:
     - B-L475E-IOT01A board. 

  - B-L475E-IOT01A Discovery board Set-up    
    - Connect the Discovery board to your PC with a USB cable type A to mini-B 
      to ST-LINK connector (CN1).
    - Please ensure that the ST-LINK connectors and jumpers are fitted.

  - When using Android Phone
    - Activate "NFC"
    - Default Android application should handle the reading of the NFC tag

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
  - Open your preferred toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the example
