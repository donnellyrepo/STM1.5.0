@par Application Description 

This application shows how to use the Es-WiFi module to perform a TCP client mode
using STM32Cube HAL. It demonstrates how to set up a client program and connect it 
to a TCP server.

The Inventek eS-WiFi module is offered with a complete TCP/IP stack and requires 
only a simple AT command over the SPI interface to communicate with the module.

In a typical embedded application, the STM32 microcontroller is used to send the 
AT command to initiate a client connection. 

The es-wifi module starts to connect to an access point. Once connected, we should 
connect to a specific server. The address of the server is declared in RemoteIP[] 
in main.c.
Then, the es-wifi module will be initiated as a client and connected to the server and 
will check the connection. 8002 is the standard port number used for access.
If connection is successful, the client sends a message "STM32:Hello!" 
to the server.
While connection by the client is still alive, the server and client can communicate. 

If the USART is used to output a message on hyperterminal(#define TERMINAL_USE in 
main.c), log messages will be displayed on Hyperterminal to inform user about 
es_wifi module status and the IP address value, else this will be ensured by LEDs:
  + LED2 On: error connection.

This application may be used with a Smartphone (more detailed setup
instructions are described in section "Hardware and Software environment").

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32L475XX devices.
    
  - This application has been tested with the following environment:
     - B-L475E-IOT01A Rev-C board. 
 
 - Connect ST-Link cable to the PC USB port to display data on the HyperTerminal. 
    A virtual COM port will then appear in the HyperTerminal. 

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Data Length = 7 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - Parity None
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Flow control: None 

  - Using Android Phone
    - Configure a phone as Access Point
    - Connect another phone to this Network
    - Update in main.c the following defines SSID and PASSWORD with your own AP settings
    - Open TCP Server application already installed on the smartphone (link: https://play.google.com/store/search?q=tcp%20server&c=apps&hl=en )
    - Get the IP address of the server and update the RemoteIP variable in main.c
    - Set server port number to 8002 and press create server
 
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Check that DK board is connected to a remote PC before running the application
 - Run the application
