@par Application Description

How to enter and exit low-power mode with CMSIS RTOS API with LPTIM used as clock source
for both RTOS and HAL ticks.

This example creates one thread that toggle a LED then blocks for 1 sec . Blocking for a 
finite period allows the kernel to stop the tick interrupt and place the STM32 into Stop mode.

In this example, non-used GPIOs are configured to analog, thus helping to reduce 
the power consumption of the device.

The RTOS tick is suppressed while the MCU is in the low power state.
The LPTIM is used as clock source for both RTOS and HAL ticks.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set according 
      to the OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to 
	  the upper Kbyte boundary.

on STM32Cube with RTOS".

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L475xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with a B-L475E_IOT01 Rev C board embedding
    a STM32L475xx device and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
