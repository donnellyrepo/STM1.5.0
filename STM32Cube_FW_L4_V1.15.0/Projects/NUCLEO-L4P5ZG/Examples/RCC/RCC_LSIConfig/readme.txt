@par Example Description

How to enable/disable the low-speed internal (LSI) RC oscillator (about 32 KHz) at run time, using the RCC HAL API.

Board: NUCLEO-L4P5ZG (144 pins) (embeds a STM32L4P5ZGT6 device)
Microcontroller Clock Output MCO1 Pin: PA.08

In this example, after startup, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
MSI as clock source, the User push-button (connected to External line 13)
is used to enable/disable LSI.
- on the very first press, LSI is enabled without any division factor
- then, on each successive user button press, the LSI is toggled (disabled or enabled)
Every other LSI enabling, LSI is divided by 128.


LSI clock waveform is available on the MCO1 pin PA.08 and can be captured
on an oscilloscope.

In case of configuration error, LED3 is turned on.


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L4P5xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-L4P5ZG (144 pins)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
