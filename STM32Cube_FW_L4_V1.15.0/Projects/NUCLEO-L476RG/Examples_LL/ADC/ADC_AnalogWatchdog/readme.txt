@par Example Description

How to use an ADC peripheral with an ADC analog watchdog to monitor a channel 
and detect when the corresponding conversion data is outside the window 
thresholds.

This example is based on the STM32L4xx ADC 
LL API. The peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in continuous conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
Analog watchdog is configured to monitor all channels on group regular
(therefore, including the selected channel), 
low threshold is set to 0V and high threshold is set to Vdda/2.
ADC interruption enabled: Analog watchdog 1.

Example execution:
From the main program execution, the ADC converts the selected channel continuously.
When conversion data is out of analog watchdog window, ADC interruption occurs.
Into analog watchdog callback function, a status variable is set
and a LED2 is turned-on.
At each press on push button, the ADC analog watchdog is rearmed to be ready
for another trig.

Note: In case of noise on voltage applied on ADC channel input, ADC analog watchdog
      may trig at a voltage level with an uncertainty of tens of mV.

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "ubAnalogWatchdog1Status": analog watchdog state

Connection needed:
None.
Note: Optionally, a voltage can be supplied to the analog input pin (cf pin below),
      between 0V and Vdda=3.3V, to perform a ADC conversion on a determined
      voltage level.
      Otherwise, this pin can be let floating (in this case ADC conversion data
      will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for push button
  1 GPIO for LED2
  1 GPIO for analog input: PA.04 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32)
