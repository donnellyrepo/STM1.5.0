@par Example Description

How to use a comparator peripheral to compare a voltage level applied on a GPIO
pin to the internal voltage reference (VREFINT). 
The comparator output is connected to a GPIO. This example is based on the STM32L4xx COMP LL
API. The peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions for
optimization purpose (performance and size).

Example configuration:
Comparator instance COMP1 is configured to compare:
 - input plus set to a GPIO pin (cf pin below) in analog mode.
 - input minus set to internal voltage reference VrefInt (voltage level 1.2V,
   refer to device datasheet for min/typ/max values)
A GPIO pin a configured in alternate function to be connected directly
to comparator output (cf pin below).
Comparator is set in power mode ultra low power.

Example execution:
From the main program execution, comparator is enabled.
Each time the voltage level applied on GPIO pin (comparator input plus) 
is crossing VrefInt voltage threshold (comparator input minus),
the comparator output is setting the logical level on GPIO.
LED is turned on or off depending on comparator output state (monitoring
of state of GPIO connected to comparator output):
turned on if comparator voltage level on input plus is higher than input minus,
turned-off otherwise.

Connection needed:
A voltage must be supplied to the analog input pin (cf pin below),
between Vdda=3.3V and 0V. Otherwise this pin can be let floating (but in this
case COMP comparison level will be undetermined).

To check comparator threshold, you can:
 - Either use a wire to connect the GPIO pin of comparator input (cf pin below)
   to other connectors on board:
    - below comparator threshold: to ground
    - above comparator threshold: to voltage of power supply Vdda
      (on board Nucleo: Vdda=3.3V, available on CN6 pin 4 or CN7 pin 5)
 - Either use an external power supply

Other peripheral used:
  1 GPIO for LED
  1 GPIO for analog input of comparator: PC.05 (Morpho connector CN10 pin 6)
  1 GPIO for digital output of comparator: PB.00 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A3, Morpho connector CN7 pin 34)
