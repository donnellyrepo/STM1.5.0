@par Example Description

Configuration of the WWDG to periodically update the counter and 
generate an MCU WWDG reset when a user button is pressed. The peripheral initialization 
uses the LL unitary service functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Example Configuration:
Configure the WWDG (Window, Prescaler & Counter) and enable it.
Refresh the WWDG downcounter in the main loop - LED2 is blinking fastly & continuously

Example Execution:
When User push-button is pressed, the Downcounter automatic refresh mechanism is disabled and thus, reset occurs.
After a reset when re-entering the main function, RCC WWDG Reset Flag is checked and if we are back from a WWDG reset the LED2 is switched ON.

A new User push-button press re-activates the WWDG.
